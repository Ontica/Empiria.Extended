Empiria Web Api Client
======================

Empiria Web Api Client has types to connect .NET-based client applications to
Empiria HTTP/RESTful web services, and to third party Http services as well.

This infrastructure uses Empiria Web Services Directory in order to simplify
endpoint configuration and management, providing a very simple to use interface.
