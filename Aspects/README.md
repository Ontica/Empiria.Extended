Provides an infrastructure for handling the execution and modularization of
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) cross-cutting concerns like security,
logging, exception handling or transaction management.

Preconditions, postconditions and class invariants.

In general, provides types that changes or adds new behavior to existing
code in runtime, executing system's or business's policies and rules that
can be defined and configured in data and linked using dynamic binding.
